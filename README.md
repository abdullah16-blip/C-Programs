download .net framework latest version online,

Install .net framework, 

Open cmd, 

((set path of cmd by using (set path="") command.))==this means adding path in environment variables, 
generally the path would look like: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319

Now go to the folder (by using cmd) in which you save your c# file which you create in step 2.

Now enter csc "your file name."cs in cmd. Or type dotnet run.( you might have to look this up online because commands change according to code editor)

Now if you set correct path and your coding is correct then a .exe file is created run that file on cmd.
